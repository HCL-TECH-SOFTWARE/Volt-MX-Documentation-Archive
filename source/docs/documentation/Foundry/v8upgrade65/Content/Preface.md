Preface
=======

Volt MX  Foundry is a Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) provider that helps developers build native and web apps for mobile. Foundry allows you to define the back-end to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and HTML5-based apps for modern browsers. Foundry ensures that developers build mobile applications quickly by focusing on core areas and obtaining secured back-end services instantly. Foundry has multiple features that can be used - Identity, Integration, Orchestration, Sync, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized console.

For successful authentication with users, and to access the centralized features of Foundry, Volt MX recommends that you install the following Foundry features on premises:

*   Volt MX Foundry Identity and Console
*   Volt MX Foundry Integration Services
*   Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services
*   Volt MX Foundry Sync Services

Volt MX  Foundry supports the following back-end services for your applications:

*   Identity: This feature allows you to define the type of authentication that grants access to your application. Foundry supports the following authentication services: Microsoft Active Directory, Salesforce, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Volt MX SAP Gateway, Facebook, and Volt MX User Repository.
*   Integration: This feature allows you to define various back-end services for your application. You can define the service in XML, SOAP, JSON, Java, Salesforce, and Volt MX SAP Gateway.
*   Orchestration: This feature allows you to create two types of orchestration services. They are:
    *   Composite: You can run two or more services concurrently or sequentially.
    *   Looping: You can run a single service in a loop until the loop ends or an exit criteria is met.
*   Synchronization: This feature allows you to define the synchronization services for your application. Sync supports only Web Services, except SAP Sky.
*   Engagement Services: This feature allows you to define and configure push messaging services for your application.

> **_Important:_** Volt MX recommends using the Foundry Installer for deploying Foundry 7.0 onwards.
