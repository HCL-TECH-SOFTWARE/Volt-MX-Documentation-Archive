Upgrade Legacy Platforms
========================

Solution for Thinclient
-----------------------

From 7.0 onwards, Thinclient support has been revoked and you should use SPA.

In previous versions, Volt MX supported a server-side mobile web platform. This has been unified under SPA (Single Page Architecture) for better feature richness, performance, and.html 5 support. While moving to this model, any user, who possesses a server-side mobile web must design the forms for SPA and build the application for a different SPA-supported browser.

Users do not need to redesign the entire application but instead use the native platform mobile/tablet design and build the app for SPA. All features of native platforms except native device features are supported in SPA. Over time, browser support has also evolved in VoltMX's framework. The following link provides the list of supported browsers:

Solution for BlackBerry Native Platforms
----------------------------------------

From 7.0 onwards, support for native BlackBerry or BlackBerry 10 is not available. The following are the two options for native BlackBerry 10:

*   Build the application for BlackBerry 10 hybrid platform.

*   Convert APK to BAR.
    
    \* The conversion of APK to BAR is based on native BlackBerry 10 support.
    
    Refer to the [http://community.hclvoltmx.com/developer/forum/apk-bar-conversion-and-installation-process-along-faqs-bb10-and-apk-file](http://community.hclvoltmx.com/developer/forum/apk-bar-conversion-and-installation-process-along-faqs-bb10-and-apk-file) for the steps on converting an APK file to BAR.
