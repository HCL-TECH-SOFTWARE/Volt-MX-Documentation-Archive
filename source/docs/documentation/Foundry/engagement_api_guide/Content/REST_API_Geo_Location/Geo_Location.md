Geo Location
============

Administrators can select a geographic point using latitude and longitude, and create a virtual boundary around the point of a given radius. When a device enters or exits a geofence boarder set by administrator, a push notification is sent to that device. You can add geolocations and configure them from the Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services Console. You can also use the following **REST APIs** to add and configure geolocations.
