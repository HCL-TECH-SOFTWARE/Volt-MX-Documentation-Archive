VoltMX Licensing Guide: Preface

Preface
=======

The Volt MX product suite provides an enterprise with apps, platform, and controls that are needed to build and manage the entire enterprise mobility life cycle from a single code base.

Currently, the Volt MX product suite may be licensed as follows:

*   **Evaluation License** - This license enables the customers to evaluate the product for a limited period of time without having to pay a fee. An evaluation license may be obtained for the following products: Volt MX Iris Enterprise, Volt MX Foundry, and Volt MX Management suite Components.

*   **Commercial License** - Customers get a commercial license after executing a contract with Volt MX. The life of this commercial license adheres with the information provided in the contract. The Volt MX commercial license is provided for our entire product suite similar to aforementioned evaluation scenario.

The license can be requested for a single user or for a group of users as described below:

> **_Note:_** The Volt MX Iris Enterprise License is assigned based on Windows User Name on the host machine.

*   **Single User License** - This is a license which can be requested for a single user. This kind of license is typically requested when it is necessary to tie the license to a particular user. The license may then be used only by this user.
*   **Group License** - This is a license can be requested for a group of people. This kind of license can have a multiple activations against a single license file. However, the license is tied to the user who activated it and may be used by the same user until it is de-activated.

There are two types of activations as stated below:

*   **With Internet connection** - The type of license can be activated with an Internet connection by filling and sending the [Customer Information Form](Customer_Information_Form.html#appendix-customer-information-form).
