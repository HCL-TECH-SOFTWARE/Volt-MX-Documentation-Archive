Introduction
============

Using Volt MX Foundry Messaging, you can send notifications to subscribed applications by any one of the following three ways:

*   Messages to either subscribers or segments : Using Volt MX Foundry Messaging, messages can be sent either to the individual subscribers or segments (group of subscribers) that are associated with applications.
*   Campaign messages to subscribed applications: Using Volt MX Foundry Messaging, messages can be sent via campaigns to segments by defining the message target to segments. This is done by associating the push message/email/SMS/Apple passes to a campaign. For example, you want to send festive seasonal sales messages to a group of audience members that matches specific conditions and requirements (marital status, income, education) for a particular period. Similarly, you want to promote a brand through personalized valued based simple text messages to achieve best results for a campaign. This ensures that subscribers are engaged and appreciate the content you are sending through SMS.
*   Event messages to subscribed applications: Using Volt MX Foundry Messaging, event messages can be sent to the subscribed applications. For example, when you want to transfer money online you use a payment gateway system that is associated with your bank. A payment gateway facilitates the transfer of information between a payment portal (such as a website, mobile phone or Interactive voice response service) and the Front End Processor or acquiring bank, and performs a variety of tasks to process the transaction. During this whole process, you are updated with status of each point by event push messages.
