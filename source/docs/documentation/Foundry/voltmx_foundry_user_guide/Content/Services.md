User Guide: [Integration](#integration) \> Overview



Integration
===========

Overview
--------

An Integration Service is an application component that represents the application interaction with an external system or data source. A service definition comprises the meta-data or the configurations required to exchange data with the external system or data source. For example, the configurations can be service type, Endpoint URL, service ID, type (HTTP/HTTPS), request parameters, response parameters, preprocessors and postprocessors, and authentication credentials if required.

For more hands-on approach on how to implement Integration Services, import and preview the **News and Weather** app using Volt MX Iris.

Use Cases
---------

If you want to develop an app which enables users to browse through news headlines with different categories such as _Top Stories_, _World_, _Science_, _Technology_, _Sports_, weather conditions and so on. In this scenario, you need to use Integration services of Volt MX Foundry to fetch data from 3rd party news and weather APIs, which populates the same data in the front end of the app.

Workflow of Integration Services
--------------------------------

The following workflow describes the various stages of Integration services:

![](Resources/Images/Integration-workflow_740x416.png)


|**Service Request flow**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| a. **Request** A client sends a **request** to Volt MX Foundry.<br> b. **Filter**<br> c. **Message Parser (JSON, Form Encoded)**<br> d. **Pre-Processor** After Volt MX Foundry receives the call from the device, Volt MX Foundry executes custom Java/JS code based on the configured **Pre-Processor** before making any outbound calls.The custom Java/JS code is typically used to decide on what service to call. The custom code can also perform data validation on the request input.<br> e. **Request Builder (Velocity Template)** For adapters (such as XML, JSON), user can format the request sent to an enterprise backend by defining a [velocity template](http://velocity.apache.org/).<br> f. **Adapters** An adapter is the component that communicates to the backend. it takes the formatted request from the request builder and sends it to the enterprise backend. In addition to the out of the box adapters, we can import adapters from [VoltMX Marketplace](https://marketplace.voltmx.com/domain/general?category=2124).<br> **_Note_:** You can select the **Enable pass-through** check box in the **Request Input** tab for Volt MX Foundry to forward the headers and body of clients request to the back end as is.|

|**Service Response flow**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| a. **Adapters** An adapter receives the response from the enterprise backend for further processing in Volt MX Foundry.<br> b. **Response Builder** Volt MX Foundry extracts data from the backend payload using **XPath** or **JSON Path** in the form of response parameters.<br> c.**Post-Processor** After extracting the data, Foundry executes the custom Java/JS code based on the configured **Post-Processor**.The custom Java/JS code is typically used to process the data before returning the data to the client. The custom code can also determine whether Foundry needs to make additional service calls.<br> c. **Message Formatter (JSON)**<br> e. **Filter** <br> f. **Response** Volt MX Foundry sends the transformed **response** (in JSON) to the client.<br> **_Note:_** You can select the **Enable pass-through** check box in the **Response Output** tab for Volt MX Foundry to forward the response from the back end as is to clients.|


Supported Endpoint Adapters
---------------------------

Volt MX  Integration supports back-end connectivity to Web services such as XML, JSON, JavaScript, Database, Salesforce and so on. If external data sources do not expose the services to these well-known interfaces, you can build a Java service with a custom code.

Out of the box Volt MX Foundry Integration Services support connectivity to the following different endpoint adapters.
