Publishing Native Client Binaries from Volt MX Management to Devices
====================================================================

After you publish native client binaries from Volt MX Foundry Console to a Volt MX Management environment, the app with these native client binaries needs to be updated in Volt MX Management Console.

Go to Volt MX Management Console, enable the new update of application and target the app to Volt MX Management Users. In Volt MX Management Console, an admin targets the uploaded version of the app binaries to the enrolled users and then publishes the app binaries from Volt MX Management Console. For more details, refer to [VoltMX Management Console User Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/management/voltmxemm/Content/VoltMX_Management_User_Guide.html).
