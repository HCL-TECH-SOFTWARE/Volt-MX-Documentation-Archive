Application Level
=================

This set of APIs help the developer to perform various ORM operations at Application level.

sync.init
---------

This function initializes the creation of device database as well sync environment. On successful sync init, the database structure without data (schema) gets created in the device database. Once the client database is created, subsequent calls to _sync.init_ just initialize the sync environment.

> **_Note:_** You should always call this function after application re-start and before you perform any Sync operation. You need to perform the _sync.init_ function only once in the life span of an application.

### Signature

_sync.init (**initSuccessCallback ,initFailCallback**)_

### Parameters

*   initSuccessCallback\[function\] - Optional
    
    Specifies the function that gets invoked on success
    
*   initFailCallback\[function\] - Optional
    
    Specifies the function that gets invoked on failure
    

### Platform Availability

Available on all platforms [mentioned](Overview.html#Supporte).

### Example

{% highlight voltMx %}function syncInit(){
sync.init(initSuccessCallback , initFailCallback);
}

function initSuccessCallback(){
alert("Sync Initialized");
}
function initFailCallback(res){
alert("Sync Failed" + " with Error Code:" + res.errorCode + ", error message:"+ res.errorMessage + ", error information:" + JSON.stringify(res.errorInfo));
}

{% endhighlight %}

sync.startSession
-----------------

This function triggers the synchronization cycle. It receives a set of configuration as input that helps to fine tune the synchronization process to specific application needs.

### Client Side Lifecycle Events

### Configuration Parameters

  
| Parameter Name \[Mandatory/Optional\] | Parameter Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user id \[Mandatory\] | String | Specifies the user identifier to use to authenticate the user for accessing the Volt MX Foundry Sync Services |
| password \[Mandatory\] | String | Specifies the password to use to authenticate the user to access the Volt MX Foundry Sync Services |
| appid \[Mandatory\] | String | Application identifier for which the data needs to be synchronized |
| serverhost \[Mandatory\] | String | Identifies the server on which the Volt MX Foundry Sync Services are deployed. Typically a DNS (For Example: sync.voltmx.net) or a String in IP Address format (10.10.10.4). The serverhost is 'undefined' by default. |
| issecure\[Optional\] | boolean | Identifies the protocol you should use to connect to server; http or https. If issecure is not specified, 'false' is taken by default and config.issecure is configured to 'false' by default. |
| serverport \[Optional\] | String | Identifies the port on which the Volt MX Foundry Sync Services are deployed. If port is not specified, port no: 80 is taken as default. |
| sessiontasks \[Optional\] | JSObject/table | You can specify various operations scope level using session tasks: 1. **doupload /dodownload**: Allows the user to control Sync Scopes that you should consider for upload and download. It typical follows the below structure. { syncscopename : {doupload:true, dodownload:true} } Setting dodownload to _true_ indicates that user wants to download the latest changes from the Volt MX Foundry Sync Server and vice-versa. Setting doupload to _true_ indicates that the user wants to upload the latest changes in the local tables to the Volt MX Foundry Sync Server and vice-versa. 2. **uploaderrorpolicy**: This indicates what should happen when error occurs while uploading changes to server. There are two options available:
abortonerror: Abort the upload and stop the sync process for that particular scope. continueonerror: Ignore the error, continue the upload and sync process for that particular scope.

It has to follow structure:{ syncscope1: {uploaderrorpolicy: "abortonerror"},syncscope2: {uploaderrorpolicy: "continueonerror"}, } |
| sessiontasks \[Optional\] | JSObject/table | For **Example 1**:config.sessiontasks = { Scope1 : { doupload : true, dodownload : true, uploaderrorpolicy : "continueonerror" }, Scope2 : { doupload : true, dodownload : true, uploaderrorpolicy : "abortonerror" } }; For **Example 2**: config.sessiontasks = { Scope1 : {doupload : true, dodownload : false, uploaderrorpolicy :"abortonerror"}, Scope2 : {doupload : true, dodownload : false, uploaderrorpolicy: "continueonerror"}} |
| batchsize | String | Indicates the number of rows that get downloaded in one batch from the server. By default, this value is set to 500. > **_Note:_** If you have more than one record with the same lastupdatetimestamp, then irrespective of the batchsize, all the records that have the same lastupdatetimestamp are downloaded in the same batch depending upon the batch cut time. |
| filterparams | JSObject/table | Indicates the filter params or values that are used to filter data for a specific user/device. This helps to ensure that only data relevant to a specific user is sent to the device and thus making the whole process more optimized. It typically follows the below structure {ScopeName : \[{ SyncObjectName : \[{ FilterName : "ProductName", Value1 : "" , Value2 : "" }\] }\] } **For Example**: config.filterparams = { PersistentSyncScope : \[ { Products : \[ { Name : "ProductName", Value1 : "%Cha%" } \] } \] } ; |
| removeafterupload\[Optional\] | JSObject/table | Indicates that you should delete specified records from local database after successful upload. **Usage**: Suppose that there are three scopes:

scope1 with two sync objects syncObject1 and syncObject2) scope2 with two sync objects syncObject3 and syncObject4 scope3 with three sync objects syncObject4, syncObject5, and syncObject6.

Now, we want to

Delete all records in all sync objects in scope1 after upload. Delete none of the records in sync objects in scope2 after upload. Delete only records of syncObject4 and syncObject6 in scope3 after upload.

We pass config param to syn.startsession like this: config.removeafterupload = {"scope1":\[ \],"scope3":\["syncObject4", "syncObject6"\]}; P.S. Currently it is not available at record level. |

sync.startReconciliation
------------------------

sync.startReconciliation API is used to compare primary keys present in backend with application database primary keys for all objects configured in input params. It involves 2 service calls:

1.  getAllPKs - Captures all corresponding object PKs from the backend.
2.  bulkGet - Retrieves the actual record for given PKs.

From SDK, the first service call is getAllPKs used to fetch the PK values for corresponding objects. SDK compares the PKs with application database. If any extra records are found in application database, the corresponding record will be deleted. If any record is missing, the actual record will be retrieved through bulkGet service call.

> **_Important:_** PK - Primary Key

### Workflow

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end workflow of sync.startReconciliation API:

**Limitation**: If there are any pending changes in any object, then corresponding scope will be ignored in reconciliation process.

> **_Note:_** If any error / failure occurs, reconciliation starts from the scratch and does not have an option to resume its process.

> **_Note:_** For parent child relationship in sync config, it is recommended that the order of passing object names in config.reconcile param of sync.startReconciliation is first the child object has to be passed and then the parent object .

> **_Note:_** getAllPKs is a new operation which is not supported in IDE, so customer needs to map the operation manually.

sync.stopSession
----------------

You can stop the sync process using the sync.stopSession API. If you perform sync.stopsession and then sync.startsession, sync starts from where it stopped before.

### Signature

**sync.stopSession(callback)**

### Platform Availability

The Stop Sync API is supported on the following platforms:

*   iOS
*   Android
*   Windows

### Example

{% highlight voltMx %}sync.stopSession( function ()   
{   
alert(âSync has been stoppedâ);   
});
{% endhighlight %}

Following illustration shows the end-to-end workflow for the stop sync API:Â 

![](Resources/Images/StopSync_539x235.png)

### Requirements

Following are some of the key requirements that need to be enabled for the stop sync process:Â 

*   You must be able to call sync.stopSession to cancel any in progress sync.
*   If the network call is in progress, stop sync will not cancel the process right away. Instead it will wait for the network call to complete and stops triggering further sync calls (next batches or scopes).
*   If you call the sync.stopSession API multiple times, an error `Session is in Progress` appears and the sync continues.
    
*   If you call the sync.stopSession API when sync is not in progress, a sync cycle is triggered and makes network calls in background.
    
*   After the sync is stopped first the pending callbacks (like onbatchsuccess, onscopesuccess will get called before invoking the stop callback).
