Upgrading Studio Version
------------------------

1.         If the app is built in any of the Studio pre-6.5 versions, you must first migrate the app to Studio V 6.5.x latest version.
    
    > **_Important:_** Upgrade of the application is possible only from the Studio version 6.5.x (with latest hotfix).
    
2.  Once the project is in 6.5 version, do the following:
    1.  Right-click the project and select **Utilities**.
    2.  From the options available, select **Upgrade the project to the current version** (if enabled). A confirmation message appears. Click **OK**.
    3.  Right click on the project and **Refresh**.
3.  Then, build the application for the channels you have built the application. Perform a basic sanity check of your app.
    
4.  Ensure that you take a backup of the working version of the app that is migrated to the 6.5.x version.
