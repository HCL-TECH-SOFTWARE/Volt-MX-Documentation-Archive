Create, Migrate, or Import a Project
====================================

Whether it's an application for phones, tablets, wearables, or desktops, the process of creating an application in Volt MX Iris involves creating a _project_. You can create a project from sample applications and components, or from scratch. You can also import an existing project into your project, or migrate a project that was created in an earlier version of Volt MX Iris.
