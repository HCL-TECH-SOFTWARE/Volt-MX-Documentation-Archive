Storyboard View in Volt MX Iris
----------------------------------

From Volt MX Iris V9, while designing your app, you can develop a storyboard by using Storyboard view. Storyboard view in Volt MX Iris is a progressive way for you to quickly get the overall picture of an application. You can also use this feature to define simple navigation actions between various forms in a project.

Data & Services Panel Enhancements
----------------------------------

### Volt MX Foundry Node Moved to the Data & Services Panel

In Volt MX Iris, the Volt MX Foundry node and associated actions have been shifted from the Project Explorer to the Data & Services panel. This feature has been introduced to enable a unified and enhanced user experience of using Volt MX Foundry data and services from within Volt MX Iris.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/PublishVoltMXFoundryServicesApp.html#FoundryNodeinData&ServicesPanel).

### Disable/Enable the Categorization of Project Services

Previously, Project Services were categorized into Identity, Integration, and Objects by default. Even when there were not any linked services, those categories under Project Services were displayed.

From Volt MX Iris V9, the service categories are displayed under Project Services only when a service is linked from the Data & Services panel. In addition, an option to disable/enable the categorization of linked services under Project Services has been provided in the Preferences window.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.html#disable/enablecategorizationofProjectServices).

### Enhanced Discoverability of Data Storage Object Services

Data Storage Object services and related actions are now prominently displayed on the Data & Services panel in Volt MX Iris. This feature has been introduced for an enhanced discoverability and simplified usage of Data Storage Object services in Volt MX Iris.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.html#StorageServicesDiscoverability).

### Configure an Object Data Model by Importing an Excel File

From Volt MX Iris V9, you can create an object data model for an Object service by importing a locally-stored Microsoft Excel file. Earlier, you had to generate a data model in Volt MX Foundry Object services from back-end systems such as RDBMS and SAP, but not from an Excel file. With this feature, low-code developers have an easy and faster way to import an object data model from a locally-stored Excel file.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.html#configure-an-object-data-model-by-importing-an-excel-file).

### Simplified Data Storage Object Service Invocation

This feature simplifies the invocation and field definition of Data Storage Object services from the Data & Services panel. You can create a new data table object for an Object service. Several object details such as data type, Primary key, nullable, and maximum length can also be specified.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.html#create-a-data-table-for-an-object-service).

### Support for Enumeration Data Type in Object Data Model

From Volt MX Iris V9, Enumeration (enum) has been provided as a data type for a field in the object data model of an Object service. The (enum) data type allows you to add a maximum of 50 comma-separated options as valid values in a field. This data type is rendered as a drop-down list containing only those valid values that you defined, and users can choose only one option at a time for that field.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.html#EnumDatatype).

### Dynamic Customization of Data Model Objects

You can configure the generation of data model objects of an Object Service while designing your app. This enhancement enables you to select, reorder, and customize various properties of all the fields that you want to be displayed on the required screen of your app.

For more information about this feature, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.html#customize-the-generation-of-data-model-objects).

### Generation of Object Services UI for Responsive Web

The UI/UX generated for Responsive Web forms on the drag and drop of Object services has been enhanced. Instead of separate List and Detail forms, a Grid Details form and a List & Detail form have been introduced. These options are available on the drag and drop of the Get operation from the Data & Services panel.

In addition, the Entry form that gets generated currently for Web on the drag and drop of Create and Update Object service operations has been updated.
