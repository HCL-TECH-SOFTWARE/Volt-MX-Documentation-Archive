<ul>
  <li>Not all fields will have values for all scenarios. For example, SD card is not relevant for iOS and those fields will be empty for iOS. Similarly, if some information is not obtained from a device during an error or crash, the same will reflect in the report.</li>
  <li>Similar data is sometimes made available for different types of data such as Events, Session, Service Requests, Error as data is stored in different tables for them and having different fields called out enables a more optimized query to run if only one type of network call is used in a custom report.</li>
  <li>
    <p>All duration fields indicate time duration in milliseconds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>To view only Custom Metrics service-related data for an application, add a pre-filter or filter while creating reports for Service ID equals “capturevoltmxcustommetrics”.</li>
