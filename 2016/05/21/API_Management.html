<p>User Guide: How to Create an Identity Service in API Management &gt; APIs</p>

<h1 id="apis--api-management">APIs - API Management</h1>

<p>A Quantum Fabric app comprises a group of services, <a href="Export-Import_Apps.htm#Shared-NonSharedServices">shared and non-shared services</a>. With API Management, you can manage (create, edit, and delete) shared services (identity, integration, orchestration, objects, and logic for Node.js services) without linking or configuring them within an app. After configuring the services in the <strong>APIs</strong> page, you can edit, clone, view a sample code, and delete a service. When you create the services in the <strong>APIs</strong> page, the services are not linked to apps automatically. You can link the services across any apps created for that account in Quantum Fabric Console. The <strong>APIs</strong> page also allows you to view the list of apps or services that are using or referencing a given service. When you make changes to the services in the <strong>APIs</strong> page, the changes will be reflected in the services associated with other apps.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong>  You can edit a service. When you make a change to the service, the changes will be reflected in the services associated with other apps.</p>

<p>You cannot delete a service if it is associated with an app or a service.</p>

<p>To create services through the APIs page, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the Quantum Fabric Console, in the left-pane, click the <strong>API Management</strong> tab to display the services tabs such as <strong>APIs</strong>, <strong>Custom Code</strong>, and <strong>Custom Data Adapters</strong>. By default the <strong>Identity</strong> service tab is selected under the <strong>APIs</strong> tab.</p>

    <p><img src="Resources/Images/OnPrem/AppMgmtIdt_670x427.png" alt="" /></p>

    <p>Under the <strong>APIs</strong> page, the <strong>Identity</strong>, <strong>Integration</strong>, <strong>Orchestration</strong>, <strong>Objects</strong>, and <strong>Logic</strong> tabs appear and display list the existing services (if any). Under the <strong>APIs</strong>, the <strong>Identity</strong>, <strong>Integration</strong>, <strong>Orchestration</strong>, and <strong>Objects</strong> views display the following columns:</p>

    <p>| Column | Description |
| — | — |
| NAME | Displays the Name of the service. |
| URL | 
Displays the URL of the service.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The URL column is displayed only for identity service.</p>

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ENDPOINT TEYnPdEp / SERVICE TYPE</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Displays the type of the service. The TYPE column is displayed only for identity service.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong>  The SERVICE TYPE column is displayed only for integration service.</p>

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ASSOCIATED APPS</td>
          <td>Displays the <strong>View</strong> hyperlink. When you click the <strong>View</strong> link, the system displays the <strong>Associated Apps</strong> page.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>The <strong>Associated Apps</strong> page displays the number of apps associated with a particular service. For more details, refer to <strong><a href="#How">Associated Apps</a></strong></td>
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> </td>
          <td>MODIFIED BY</td>
          <td>Displays the name of the user.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> </td>
          <td>MODIFIED ON</td>
          <td>Displays the date and time of the modified service.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>APIs</strong> page, follow these steps to create services:</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="context-based-options">Context Based Options</h2>

<p>You can perform various actions on an existing service from the <strong>API Management</strong> page.</p>

<p>In the API Management page, click the contextual menu of the required service. It contains the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Opens a service in the console and allows you to edit the service definition and operations. After you edit a service, you need to republish all the apps that are using the service to apply the changes.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If a service is a part of a published app, you can rename that service only after the app is unpublished.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Edit Configuration</strong>: For objects services, opens the service in the console and allows you to edit the objects service definition and operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Clone</strong>: Duplicates an existing service. Clone a service to create a different version of the service. Changes made to a cloned service will not affect the original service. The name of a cloned service indicates that it is a copy of an existing service.</li>
  <li><strong>Clone App Data Model</strong>: For objects services, duplicates an existing app data model of an objects service. Clone a service to create a different version of the service. Changes made to a cloned service will not affect the original service. The name of a cloned service indicates that it is a copy of an existing service.</li>
  <li><strong>Publish Service</strong>: Republishes a service. Refer <a href="Publish_a_Service.htm">Publishing Individual Services</a></li>
  <li><strong>Sample Code</strong>: Generates dynamic code for each SDK type based on the configuration of a service. You can use the code in your mobile app. For example, generate the sample code for an integration or orchestration service from Quantum Fabric. Then use that code in the mobile app to invoke the orchestration service instance.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete all versions</strong>: Deletes all versions of a service. You cannot delete a version of the service that is in use. A service in use is a service that is referenced by a Quantum Fabric app or another service or a Sync scope.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <strong>Delete all versions</strong> button to display the <strong>Delete Service</strong> dialog.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>DELETE</strong>. If the current of the service is not linked to any apps, the versions is deleted. Otherwise, the Error warns you that you are trying to delete the current version of the service that cannot be unlinked or deleted as it is being used by the following apps or services or Sync scopes: [App Name]</p>

    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If a service is a part of a published app, you can delete that service only after you unlink the service from all the published app.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Manage versions</strong>: Delete one or more versions of a service.
    <ol>
      <li>Click the <strong>Manage versions</strong> button to display the <strong>Manage versions</strong> dialog lists versions of the service.</li>
      <li>Hover your cursor over the required version, and click the <strong>Delete</strong> button. When you click the <strong>Delete</strong> button, the <strong>Delete Service</strong> dialog appears.</li>
      <li>
        <p>To confirm the deletion of the version, click <strong>DELETE</strong>. If the current version of the service is not linked to any apps, the versions is deleted. Otherwise, the Error warns you that you are trying to delete the current version of the service that cannot be unlinked or deleted as it is being used by the following apps or services or Sync scopes: [App Name]</p>

        <p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong> You cannot remove the current version of a service from a service level. <br />
For example, If you are in the <strong>Service Definition</strong> tab of a service from <strong>APIs</strong> and try to delete a version of a service, you can delete all the versions of a service except the current version.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Audit Logs</strong> helps you to capture all the user activities performed in a service. <strong>Object Name</strong>, <strong>Object Type</strong> and <strong>Modified On</strong> fields are prepopulated with the <strong>Service Name</strong>, <strong>Services</strong>, and <strong>Last 7 Days</strong> respectively.</p>

    <p>For more information on Audit Logs, refer to <a href="Settings_Cloud.htm#AuditLogs-Cloud">Audit Logs</a> documentation.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> This feature is applicable only for Integration, Orchestration, and Object Services.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Console Access Control</strong>: Controls the access to the applications and services of apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Export as XML</strong>: Exports an existing version of a service to an XML file.</li>
  <li><strong>Export</strong>: Exports an existing version of a service to a zip file. You can import the service to an existing app in the Quantum Fabric Console. For more information, refer <a href="Export-Import_Apps.htm">Exporting and Importing an Application</a>.</li>
